# Maze-Game-using-Sounds-in-CodeBlocks

Application of Two-Dimensional Tables - a maze-type game in which a character 
(coordinated by the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrows) must find the key and leave the maze.

This application requires the use of the sound module used in CodeBlocks - background music, 
changing the animation and music when the key is discovered and when the character leaves 
the maze with the corresponding message "BRAVO".
